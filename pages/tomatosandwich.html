    <h2>The Undisputed King of Sandwiches.</h2>
        <p>Brilliant in its simplicity, resplendant in its supreme balance of flavour.
             Many argue that all other sandwiches are a waste of time as the art 
             of sandwichmaking had already been perfected centuries ago.

        <p>Thinly sliced tomato on fresh white bread, smeared with butter. Dusted with 
            sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Impeccable.
