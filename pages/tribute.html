    <div>  
    <p>John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, PC, FRS (13 November 1718 â€“ 30 April 1792) was a British 
            statesman who succeeded his grandfather Edward Montagu, 3rd Earl of Sandwich as the Earl of 
            Sandwich in 1729, at the age of ten. During his life, he held various military and political 
            offices, including Postmaster General, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Secretary of State for
             the Northern Department. He is also known for the claim that he was the eponymous inventor of 
             the sandwich. </p>
    
        <h3>The Sandwich Genesis</h3>
        
        <p>Lord Sandwich was a very conversant gambler, the story goes, and he did not take the 
            time to have a meal during his long hours playing at the card table. Consequently, 
            he would ask his servants to bring him slices of meat between two slices of bread, 
            a habit well known among his gambling friends. Other people, according to this 
            account, began to order "the same as Sandwich!", and thus the "sandwich" was born.</p>
