    <h2>Бутерброд, the way babushka used to make it.</h2>
        <p>The quintessential Russian sandwich, adopted
             from the Germans as far back as the 17th 
             century. To make butterbrod you only really 
             need 2 things: bread and butter. Luckily the 
             war is over comrade, and there is no need to 
             ration supplies. This means that basically 
             anything can and will go on butterbrod. </p>

             <p>Although the options are endless, there still is such a thing as
                 a classic butterbrod, for that you need Doctor's Sausage (Russian bologna)</p>
             </p>
