            Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and 
            journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition
             to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a
              fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of 
              society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes. </p>
